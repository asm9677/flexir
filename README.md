## 1. Service Overview

Flexir is an innovative platform designed to improve the liquidity of points in the crypto market. By enabling the trading of points even before the Token Generation Event (TGE), Flexir provides users with greater freedom to manage and trade their assets effectively.

## 2. Problem Definition

In the crypto market, points are generally illiquid until the TGE, creating significant liquidity constraints for investors. Existing platforms like Whales Market attempt to address this issue by opening forward markets backed by deposits; however, liquidity remains limited because these deposits are locked until the TGE.

## 3. Solution

Flexir leverages technology that enables real-time transfer of contract ownership through smart contracts, allowing transactions to be resold even before the TGE. This approach allows investors to freely trade assets pre-TGE, effectively solving liquidity challenges. Flexir’s core technology automatically updates wallet addresses upon each transaction, ensuring seamless ownership transfer via smart contracts.

## 4. Target Market

Flexir’s primary target customers are advanced crypto users who are familiar with point activities. These users require fast, flexible asset management and an intuitive UI/UX that allows for straightforward trading.

## 5. Business Model

Flexir generates revenue by charging a small fee per transaction. With a minimal fee rate of 0.25%, an estimated daily transaction volume of $1 million could yield approximately $900,000 annually. Additionally, Flexir plans to diversify its revenue streams by incorporating pre-market, OTC, and RWA market functionalities.

## 6. Competitive Advantage

Flexir initially targets users of platforms like Whales Market and AEVO by analyzing transactions to identify existing users and validate the service’s potential. Unlike Whales Market, Flexir maximizes liquidity through its contract resale mechanism, allowing users to liquidate assets even before the TGE. Furthermore, Flexir offers both a points market and an NFT market—features not supported by AEVO—providing users with a wider range of trading options to optimize their transactions.

## 7. Growth Strategy

Flexir aims to acquire early users through viral marketing, influencer collaborations, and active community engagement. By partnering with various new projects and major blockchain projects, Flexir intends to broaden its market presence. User convenience will be further enhanced through UI/UX improvements and the launch of a mobile app.

## 10. Feedback

Flexir deployed its DApp on the blockchain, ensuring high security and extensive network support. Through its smart contract capabilities, we were able to implement flexible and automated asset trading, providing users with a reliable trading environment.

However, we have experienced that the transaction fees are somewhat high, which may impact the user experience. We are actively exploring solutions to optimize and reduce these fees to improve overall platform usability.
